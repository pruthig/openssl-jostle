/**
 * MT-14's binding mechanism: the four cells of {@code PKEYKeySpec.usableBy},
 * pinned directly rather than through the surfaces that delegate to it.
 *
 * <p>Written during Phase 1 so the decision every acceptance point relies on
 * had coverage before anything depended on it, and kept afterwards because it
 * is the only place the cells are stated as a contract. It is green in both
 * phases; what changed at the flip is only how each side is BUILT.
 *
 * <p><b>Where an unbound spec comes from after the flip.</b> Every registered
 * service now binds, so {@code KeyPairGenerator.getInstance(alg, "JSL")} no
 * longer yields one — {@link #unboundSpec()} constructs the SPI directly
 * instead, which is exactly the realm the unbound cells exist to protect. A
 * key from a registered provider is the BOUND side, and this file builds both
 * deliberately rather than letting either fall out of a default.
 *
 * <p>The four cells are a DEFINED contract, not a consequence of a null
 * comparison. In particular {@code unbound x unbound} accepts on purpose:
 * refusing it would break every direct-SPI consumer, since a KeyPairGenerator
 * constructed outside any provider would produce keys its own sibling SPIs
 * reject. The unbound realm has no provider boundary to protect.
