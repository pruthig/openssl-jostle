/**
 * What the FIPS module that is actually loaded can do.
 *
 * <p>JSLFIPS ships ONE build that has to serve two modules which disagree
 * about what they implement — the CMVP-validated 3.1.2 and a 3.5.x once its
 * certificate lands — and they disagree in <i>both</i> directions, so no
 * compiled-in registration list is right for both. Registration is therefore
 * decided by asking the loaded module, not by transcribing a table (the rule
 * in {@code java-spi.md}: <i>OpenSSL is the single source of truth — query and
 * cache, never transcribe</i>).
 *
 * <h2>Scope — read before adding anything here</h2>
 *
 * Probing exists <b>only</b> for capabilities that legitimately differ between
 * <i>supported</i> modules. Everything else is a build-time question, answered
 * by {@code FIPSServedSurfaceSmokeTest} against whichever module CI pins. A
 * blanket probe over every algorithm would add cache and thread-safety
 * machinery to ~145 services that need none, and — worse — would make a
 * genuinely broken module load indistinguishable from a legitimately absent
 * feature. Fail loud, as the rest of this codebase does.
 *
 * <p>Two kinds of question, two mechanisms:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li><b>"Should this be registered?"</b> — must be answered at provider
 *       construction, so only a cheap probe can inform it. Where one can,
 *       conditional registration beats a use-time gate:
 *       {@code NoSuchAlgorithmException} from {@code getInstance} is a cleaner
 *       contract than a service that resolves and then refuses, and it lets
 *       the caller fall through to another provider. This class serves that
 *       question. Currently: X25519 / X448, whose keymgmt fetch succeeds on
 *       3.1.2 and fails on 3.5.8; and ML-KEM / ML-DSA / SLH-DSA, the other way
 *       round - 3.5.x implements all three and 3.1.2 implements none. For PQC
 *       the fetch is a COMPLETE answer. The fetch half is measured by
 *       {@code fips-c-review/probes/keymgmt_fetch_probe.c}; the
 *       operations-actually-run half by the 2026-08-31 three-config sweep,
 *       where the FIPS PQC classes passed against both 3.5.8 configs. (The
 *       older {@code pqc_op_probe.c} is cited nowhere now: it does not build —
 *       it includes a {@code ctx.inc} that is not in the tree.) Unlike DSA
 *       signing, no config switch gates it, so no failure classifier is needed. Also
 *       Ed25519 / Ed448 — the inverse of X25519/X448, absent on 3.1.2 and
 *       present on 3.5.8 — which additionally need
 *       {@link #canFetchSignature} because that family is not
 *       all-or-nothing. And Triple-DES, whose cipher fetch is refused on 3.1.2
 *       and served on 3.5.8 - see {@link #canFetchCipher}, and note that only
 *       the REGISTRATION half is decided here: whether the module will
 *       ENCRYPT with it is a fipsinstall switch no fetch can see, classified
 *       in C like DSA signing.</li>
 *   <li><b>"Will this operation actually work?"</b> — answerable only by doing
 *       it, so it is <b>not</b> here. DSA key generation and PKCS#1 v1.5
 *       encrypt both fetch and init happily on either module; only the real
 *       call refuses. Those are classified where they fail, in C, and surface
 *       as {@link org.openssl.jostle.jcajce.provider.ProviderCapabilityException}
 *       (see {@code classify_dsa_gen_failure} in {@code dsa.c}).</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>Adding a third entry is a deliberate act: it needs a
 * {@code fips-c-review/probes/capability_probe.c} run showing the two modules
 * genuinely disagree, and the measured evidence recorded at the gate.
 *
 * <p>This is <b>capability</b> filtering, never <b>approval</b> filtering.
 * JSLFIPS deliberately does not filter its surface against the security
 * policy's approved-services tables — that determination belongs to the
 * operator, and hand-maintaining a subset is how working algorithms were
 * removed from callers in the past. A service absent here is absent because
 * the module cannot perform it at all.
