/**
 * What the mainline libcrypto JSL was built against can actually do.
 *
 * <p>JSL links whatever libcrypto the distributor supplied, and the PQC
 * families need OpenSSL 3.5 or later. Registered unconditionally they resolve
 * through {@code getInstance} and then fail at first use — the
 * "registration is not usability" trap the FIPS side already avoids.
 * {@code NoSuchAlgorithmException} is the cleaner contract, and it lets the
 * caller fall through to another provider.
 *
 * <p>Scope, as for {@code FIPSCapabilities}: probe only what legitimately
 * differs between supported builds, and only where a cheap side-effect-free
 * question answers it. A capability that only the real operation reveals is
 * classified where it fails, in C. This is <b>capability</b> filtering, never
 * <b>approval</b> filtering.
 *
 * <p>Currently: ML-KEM, ML-DSA, SLH-DSA and the four TLS hybrid groups.
 * Measured 2026-08-28 by {@code fips-c-review/probes/base_pqc_gate_probe.c} —
 * every one of those names fetches on the project's build target (3.5.8) and
 * on 3.6.2, so on either the gate is all-true and its absent arm does not
 * execute. It exists for the older libcrypto a distributor may link, and no
 * available configuration exercises it; see {@code BaseCapabilityGateTest},
 * which says so rather than leaving it to be discovered.
